## The OpenCollar AO

###### A server side animation overrider with graphical user interface.

The OpenCollar AO uses current LSL functions for server side animation overriding and runs within only a single script. "Typing" and "Swimming" have been removed to save on resource intense "state checks". Share-alike button textures and the most important animations for "AO sets" can be found in the ``./res`` directory of this repo.
